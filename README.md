# EduApp

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind EduApp stems from the desire to alleviate the burdens of traditional note-taking in educational settings. We understand the challenges students face in balancing active engagement with lectures and the need to take detailed notes. EduApp aims to revolutionize this process by automating note-taking, enabling students to focus more on understanding the material and engaging with teachers.

## What it does
EduApp is an innovative note-taking application that enhances the learning experience through automation. Its key features include:

- **Audio Capturing:** Record lectures in real-time using the app.
- **AI Note Generation:** Automatically generate detailed notes from the recorded audio using advanced AI algorithms.
- **AI Quiz Creation:** Create customized quizzes based on the generated notes to reinforce learning and comprehension.
- **Dashboard:** Monitor performance in subjects through a user-friendly dashboard.

## How we built it
EduApp is built using a combination of frontend and backend technologies:

**Frontend:**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- SCSS

**Backend:**
- Python
- Django

**Database:**
- SQLite3 (for development)
- MySQL (for production)

We leveraged Django's powerful framework for building web applications, integrating frontend components with backend functionalities seamlessly. Advanced AI algorithms were implemented to enable note generation and quiz creation based on recorded lectures.
